# PySpark_PCA_Iter
This was a project for CS 724 at ODU under Dr. Zubair.  The program conducts a Principal Componenet Analysis using PySpark.  Because run in parallel the normal PCA eigen vector/values could not be calculated as normal and I used the power iter.  This was shown to be very close to the traditional method, but quicker for large sets of data.
